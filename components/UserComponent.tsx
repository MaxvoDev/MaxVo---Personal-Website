                <p className="mt-4">I'm currently <span className="text-[#0f0]">{getCurrentAge()}</span> years old (age updates automatically ðŸ˜‰)!</p>
                <p className="mt-4">I was born in <span className="text-[#0f0]">Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam</span> and currently living in <span className="text-[#0f0]">Adelaide, Australia</span>. Iâ€™ve always been a great problem solver, an independent learner and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices and tech. Today, Iâ€™m working as a software engineer and I get to show off all the elements of who I am.</p>
                <p className="mt-4">I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. After a college education in Criminology/IT Security, I continued to pursue my hobby and finished a degree in Computer Science. I realised software engineering was the right field for me.</p>
                <p className="mt-4">Since then, I have worked on a countless number of projects and experienced hands on work with clients while making some great work buddies along the way. I love to learn, love to teach others and love to solve complex tasks which have never been tackled before. I describe myself as a technology agnostic person who can adapt to new tech super quickly.</p>
                <p className="mt-4">Iâ€™m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including Javascript/Typescript, HTML, CSS, a variety of the latest JS Frameworks (Angular/React etc.), .NET & C#, Python, C++. I'm a fanboy for automating manual tasks and most of all, I adore making a difference and being recognised as a passionate worker.</p>
